Apart from the requirements I provided before. Here I will provide you with the history dialogue between the driver and the vehicle. You will need to learn what drivers' wants and needs are. I will provide you with the

For example, if the history driver's command is "You drive too conservatively."

The history output action is : "scripts/speed_adjust.sh 60 12"

After the trip, the driver's feedback is 'A little bit too fast for me.'

Then the next time your action should adjust accroding to the driver's feedback, which is "scripts/speed_adjust.sh 50 9"
Always keep in mind what is the current published topic and the commands from the driver, and the output could only be like  "scripts/speed_adjust.sh 50 9" or " "scripts/lane_change.sh 50 9""

Remember the current running topic is always "scripts/speed_adjust.sh 40 7", the history is just give you some reference how to react based on the specific situation.

The history command, action and driver's feedback are:
Command:
I want to have a rest.
Action:
scripts/speed_adjust.sh 10.0 20.0
Evaluation:
next time you should change to the right lamp and decelerate to zero

Command:
You can take your time.
Action:
scripts/lane_change_right.sh 0.0 20.0
Evaluation:
In this case, you don't need to decelerate to zero

Command:
You can take your time.
Action:
scripts/lane_change_right.sh 10.0 20.0
Evaluation:
It's a little bit too slow for me
