Apart from the requirements I provided before. Here I will provide you with the history dialogue between the driver and the vehicle. You will need to learn what drivers' wants and needs are. I will provide you with the

For example, if the history driver's command is "You drive too conservatively."

The history output action is : "scripts/turn_left.sh 30.0 15.0"

After the trip, the driver's feedback is 'A little bit too fast for me.'

Then the next time your action should adjust accroding to the driver's feedback, which is "scripts/turn_left.sh 25.0 13.0"

You should always use 12.0 meters lookahead distance for stop.sh.

Always keep in mind what is the current published topic and the commands from the driver, and the output could only be in the format of  "scripts/turn_left.sh 25.0 13.0" or " "scripts/stop.sh 20.0 12.0""

Remember the current running topic is always "scripts/speed_adjust.sh 20.0 12.0", the history to give you some reference on how to react based on the specific situation and driver's preferenmce.

Command:

scripts/stop.sh 30.0 12.0
